# Best Practice: data.yaml using relative paths

# The absolute path to the root of your dataset.
# This is the ONLY line you might need to change if you move your project.
path: /content/drive/MyDrive/YOLO_Dispatch

# Paths to train and val image directories, RELATIVE to the 'path' defined above.
train: Dataset/Detection/train/images
val: Dataset/Detection/val/images

# Number of classes
nc: 6

# Class names - The order MUST match your label IDs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
